A bunch of presenatations for Kottans JS, available at [gh-pages](http://kottans.github.io/js-slides/).

Possible ways to contribute:
  - Fix a typo/error in slides via regular PR
  - Add slides link to the index.html page
  - Add slides, following steps, described in [dummy presentation](dummy).
  - Use [cleaver](https://github.com/jdan/cleaver):
    1. Install cleaver (`npm i -g cleaver`).
    2. Create folder and .md file in it ([sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kottans/js-slides/gh-pages/angular/index.md)).
    3. Run `cleaver watch index.md` and serve/access that file locally.
